# BVND
## What it will do
The BVND will be a tool designed to show how the hypothesis testing works. This means showing visual graphs depicting what happens during a hypothesis test on a normal distribution, as well as showing the individual steps one must take to reach the final verdict on wether the alternative hypothesis shoudl be accepted or not. Along with the normal distribution, other hypothesis testing including hypothesis testing for linear correlations and binomial distribution will be available for students to get help on.
## Who this is for
This is mainly targeted for A level students who struggle to understand the normal distribution or who may stuggle figuring out what to do when presented with questions on the hypothesis testing of the normal distribution. The step by step guidance will help students better understand what to look for in question before attempting them.
